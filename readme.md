#QBank APIWrapper

## Introduction
QBankAPIWrapper is a library that makes it easy to use the QBank API directly from PHP. No need to handle the connections or interpreting the results yourself. QBankAPIWrapper also provides classes with metods for the most commonly used functions.

## Installation
When you have obtained the source files you need to make them accessible for your scripts. QBankAPIWrapper is designed to be put in a place where it is included in php.ini's *include_path*. This is to make it easy to use as a library. It is also possible to place QBankAPIWrapper in the same folder as the executing script, although it is not intended.
